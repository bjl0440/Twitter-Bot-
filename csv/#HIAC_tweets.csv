86,2022-06-06 19:20:55+00:00,Chrisfrom3TFM,"Tough break for @CodyRhodes if rumours his pectoral tear means he‚Äôll miss 6 months of action, but kudos to The American Nightmare for pushing through the pain barrier, competing and winning at #HIAC last night."
87,2022-06-06 19:20:43+00:00,Uncensored_WWE,"Cody Rhodes gave a short speech after Hell In A Cell.

Cody says he‚Äôs in pain so he‚Äôll keep it short and save the rest for RAW. 

‚ÄúNobody convinced me to compete with a torn pectoral. It was 100% my decision. 10 times out 10 I would make that choice. I LOVE YOU Chicago!

94,2022-06-06 19:18:02+00:00,HulstonStylist,"We are rightfully giving props to Cody for his #HIAC performance, but we also need to highlight Rollins. The trust the company, and his peers, must have in him to safely wrestle someone in Cody's condition must be through the roof. Hell of a wrestler."
