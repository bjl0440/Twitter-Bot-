553,2022-05-19 21:50:37+00:00,olicpfcgurks,"Seen a lot of hate to pv for this but of it happens on a street it will be the same maybe of trying to put a bad name on Vieira cus its cool and edgy it's not fair play to the everton fans who stopped it but you won it's embarrassing, everton should be ashamed 🦅🦅 https://t.co/DB0mnAFZCW"
554,2022-05-19 21:50:35+00:00,D_lfc_x,"Everton under frank is unbelievable 
16th to 16th warra manager"
555,2022-05-19 21:50:34+00:00,Folarin_AA,"Next season is pivotal for Frank. If he gets sacked by Everton midway for poor performances, he could end up as one of those coaches that only get hired by mid-table or championship clubs. He’s already had his shot at coaching the club where he became a legend, but he fell short"
556,2022-05-19 21:50:34+00:00,ShaneoNUFC,Frank Lampard will get more praise than Eddie Howe this season after taking Everton from 16th all the way upto 16th #NUFC

If every player had his desire and heart we’d be top of the table.
What a bloke 💙"
559,2022-05-19 21:50:32+00:00,Milli_ator,"Frank Lampard has kept the Toffees up. 🙌 

2022/23 will be Everton's 69th consecutive campaign in the English top-flight, only Arsenal have a longer active streak (97).

Happy for Everton to stay up but this has been their worse season in years and they’re celebrating it like avoiding relegation is a huge success!? https://t.co/CplppiLcjt"

565,2022-05-19 21:50:24+00:00,darrenmccc,Premier League &amp; FA in unenviable position now with Patrick Vieira. He’s kicked out at a fan who was antagonising him. Imagine a punishment will follow but no more than touchline ban &amp; fine perhaps? #CrystalPalace #Vieira #Everton
566,2022-05-19 21:50:23+00:00,gooner14smith,Hope that Everton that #vieira punched &amp; kicked gets a ban the little fking scrote....

588,2022-05-19 21:50:02+00:00,Ella_Davies1,Seen that Patrick viera had a fan in his face and then a altercation with said fan but what won’t get reported is the Everton fan that helped viera off the pitch after that altercation. Questions do need to be asked about security especially after recent events

Ngl this is the best Lamprds done in his career, he changed his stubborn ways and adapted to a pragmatic - cautious first approach and galvanised Everton. 

Congrats la."

Been in the shit all season and have picked themselves up and dragged themselves out of relegation trouble with just 1 game to spare. Those are scenes of pure relief...fully justified. https://t.co/Ybvzsz4HwZ"
