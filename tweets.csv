Very interesting sound palette on the record, maybe the 2nd best sounding Kendrick album to me. 

Seems very personal, which I really loved; more family and generational trauma themes. 

Obviously there’s a ton to unpack so I’m going to get to that later https://t.co/rQR3WH5zGB"

The two discs are the two acts.  

The ‘tap dancers’ are the Steppers; his critics, his enemies, his vices. 

But he’s Mr. Morale. Dancing on his own beat. Breaking the generational curse. 

Choosing himself and his family. 

Above all."
